# Node.js with Contextual Program Control

The full implementation is being done in the sibling project
[context-node](https://github.com/groboclown/context-node).

## Layout

The layout of this package is intended to be an easy insertion into the
Node.js `lib` directory, so that it can be used with the core node.js commands.
